# Overview of Supervised and Unsuperivsed Learning in Machine Learning
## Supervised Learning: It is method that learns using training data, which includes 
#                       input values(x) and correct answers(t, labels), and predicts 
#                       future values for unknown data(test data) based on learned results.

#                       => Regression and Classification

### Regression: It is a method that predicts a continuous value using training data.
### Classification: It is a method that distinguish what type of value a given 
###                 input value belongs to using training data.

### Regression(output a accurate value) vs Classification(output label)


## Unsupervised Learning: It is a method where are no correct answers in the training data, 
##                        only input data, and instead of finding answers for the inputs, 
##                        it discovers pattens, features, etc. in the input data 
##                        through learning.
